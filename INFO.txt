This mod is a sequel? update? remastering? of arcane alchemy (made by Evaisa!).
I've added many of my own ideas and reworked a few existing ideas.

If any issues arise, just leave a comment on the steam page,
I'll see it, and see what I can do to fix it.

Huge thanks to the the people in #mod-development on the noita discord.
Especially Evaisa, Tanksy, Copi, Extol, Horscht, UserK, and so many more.
Theres too many who helped to list all of you by name. (plus some of you guys got some REALLY long names that are hard to remember)

Thank you to those of you who gave me suggestions
Thank you to those of you who inspired new ideas within me
Thank you to those of you who just said "thats really cool" when i showed off my creations

Thank you to those of you who played my mod.

I never couldve come anywhere near this far without you all.
you are some of the coolest people i know.

Thanks for making dreams come true.
